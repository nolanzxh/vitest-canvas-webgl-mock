# vitest-canvas-webgl-mock

> Mock `canvas` and `WebGL` when running unit test cases with vitest.

## Disclaimer
The project is inspired by [vitest-webgl-canvas-mock](https://github.com/RSamaium/vitest-webgl-canvas-mock), and is a fork of [jest-webgl-canvas-mock](https://github.com/Adamfsk/jest-webgl-canvas-mock) so that both 2d and webgl contexts can be tested in vitest, . As such, the only tests provided are those from the original projects. 

The current goal of this project is simply to make any tests using `pixi.js` work in vitest.

Please feel free to contribute and add any additional functionality required.

## Install

This should only be installed as a development dependency (`devDependencies`) as it is only designed for testing.
